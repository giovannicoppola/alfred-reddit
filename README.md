    - `⇧` or `⌘+Y` — Show Quick Look preview of subreddit
    - `⌥+↩` - Make post in the subreddit

Description
-----------

A basic workflow to browse subreddits.

The subreddit search, `r/<query>`, uses Reddit's API to search for subreddits that match `<query>`. 25 results are retrieved by default.

The subreddit search can be a bit odd, which is due to the legendary crapness of Reddit's search function.

Search within a subreddit, `r/subreddit/<query>`, only filters the list of hot results. 50 results are retrieved by default.


Configuration
-------------

There are a couple of options in the workflow's [configuration sheet][config-sheet].

Set `NSFW` to `1` to include subreddits marked "over 18" in search results.

Set `QUICKLOOK_POST` to `1` for the Quick Look preview to show the article instead of the Reddit comment page.


Releases
